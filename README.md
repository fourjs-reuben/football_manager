INCOMPLETE - WORK IN PROGRESS

This is a rewrite of a rewrite.

This is a rewrite of Paul Rpbsons Football Manager which I got from here http://www.robsons.org.uk/archive/www.autismuk.freeserve.co.uk/ which in itself was a rewrite of Football Manager for Spectrum  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_Manager_(1982_series) written by Kevin Toms https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Toms and https://blog.kevintoms.com/  Kevin has recently released mobile versions of Football Manager, see https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/kevin-toms-football-star-manager/id1130764879 and https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gmail.toms.kevin.ktfsm&hl=en.  Download those and give Kevin some money.

This is a rewrite using Genero 3.10 (www.4js.com www.generomobile.com) intended to show off the new SCROLLGRID feature, perfect for displaying league tables.  If I do a good job with this, perhaps Kevin will consider rewriting in our toolset.

I have placed the .c .h and few license/README files I referenced from Paul Robsons version in the folder marked original.
